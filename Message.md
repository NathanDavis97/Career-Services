## Message

Hello Brian,

I noticed from your profile that you are a CodeWorks graduate and have been working as a developer for the past year. I am graduating from CodeWorks in the spring and was wondering if you would be willing to share some advice with me about entering the workforce as a developer. I am interested in hearing about your experience and any advice you could offer to a student who is about go go into the job hunt.
