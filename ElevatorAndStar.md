## Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

### S
    While I was working in my warehouse position, there was someone who was very different than I am.

### T
    We consistently had to work together throughout eight hour shifts.

### A
    I consistently tried to get along with him and tried to make the most of every situation with him.

### R
    We ended up being able to work very well with each other instead of having any real conflicts at all.


## Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
### S
    There are often times when I was working that I had to solve problems that had happened to products that were shipped to our store.

### T
    When something came damaged, I often had to work with the customer to find a solution that would work best for them.

### A
    Depending on the damage to the item, I would either offer simple fixes or money off their purchase in accordance to the regulations I was given. Other options were  to reorder it or help the customer find a different product.

### R
    Often times, I was able to find a solution that fitted the customers needs and was able to get them their product as fast as possible.


## Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
### S
    There would be times where my coworker would call out and I would have to open up our department by myself. Sometimes this would be fine, but most of the time it would be pretty stressful.

### T
I would have to get everything ready and fulfill will call requests when customers arrived, which meant moving and loading furniture by myself. 

### A
As customers would come in, I would try my best to let them know that I would be with them in a moment as I was helping a different customer. I would then quickly try to load up the first customer and help the next in order of when they arrived.

### R
I would try my best and successfully managed to get through each day and got customers in and out of the store without too much of a hiccup. It was stressful, but I was able to manage it for the most part.
Tell me about a time you had to be very strategic in order to meet all your top priorities.

### S
While on the delivery team, I would have to maintain a schedule for our delivery times and locations. 

### T
There would be upwards of about 25 deliveries per day, so I would have to help us stay on track by delivering effectively as well as maintaining contact with the customers through our phones.

### A
I would often call customers if there was a major delay as well as give them about a half an hour notice to when we were supposed to arrive.

### R
We were able to stay on track and be to our deliveries in an efficient manner and would have already communicated with the customer if something had gone wrong, making for a smooth process.


## Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?
### S
Our warehouse ran off of a fairly old software that kept track of all of the inventory, orders, and accounts.

### T
It would take  some employees up to a month to really feel comfortable with the system, so I would often have to train others on it and would be able to communicate the instructions effectively to them so they could gain understanding.

### A
I would often give hints and shortcuts if they seemed like they were understanding some parts and give more complex methods to use the software.

### R
This resulted in our crew at the time having a working understanding of the program and be able to handle most errors or problems that arose.


# Summary

To prepare for an interview, I would want to have an understanding of the company and what it is they do and potentially the technologies that they use to create their product. It would be helpful to know what software they use. I might try to familiarize myself with their website and potentially try to rebuild parts of it to gain understanding. Lastly I would try to connect with people who work there to see if I would enjoy it and see how it worked.


# Elevator Pitch


Hello, my name is Nathan Davis and I am a software developer with training in Html, JavaScript, vue, and c#. I have always liked solving puzzles and logic problems as a kid so when I started looking at career paths, I started to lean into coding as it encapsulates some of those same ideals. I took various classes in college, but it wasn’t until I started coding that I felt like I enjoyed what I was doing, which led me to seek out the training for full stack development. I really enjoy being able to make applications that are easy to use for clients that can have a true impact on their life. I want to work to make people’s lives easier with the programs I create as well as make them accessible for those who need to use them.
